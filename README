agenda
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This project provides a stupid command-line agenda tool. The agenda
tool essentially stores tasks that you need to complete (like on your
server or in life). Each task is given a unique id, followed by a
kind, description and date/time. The agenda orders the tasks by
date/time and prints outdated tasks. The 'agenda old' command displays
old tasks that have not been rebased. Rebasing involves taking an old
task file and compressing it down while rebasing the ids of current,
unfinished tasks.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[operation] agenda supports the following commands:

    stat
    add
    remove OR rm
    edit OR ed
    old
    rebase

With no arguments, agenda runs 'agenda stat'.

Agenda keeps files in the user home directory under the .agenda
subdirectory:

    ~/.agenda/agenda-current       current agenda tasks
    ~/.agenda/agenda-old           old-agenda-tasks

Rebased files are also stored there and are numbered.

[commands] detailed command descriptions:

    stat - display current tasks

    add <kind> <desc> [date/time] - add new task
        where <kind> is one of:
            hw OR homework
            paper
            proj OR project
            exam OR test
            app OR appmt OR appointment
            evnt OR event
            task OR job
            other OR misc
        where [date/time] is a date and time with the following syntax:
            <([day] [month] [year]) | day-of-week> [time] [am|pm]

            examples:
                oct 11:50 pm        -- current day of october at 11:50 pm
                8 11:50             -- 8th of current month at 11:50 am
                2034                -- current day of current month in year 2034
                fri 8 pm            -- next friday at 8 pm
                monday              -- next monday

    edit <id> [--date <date-string>] [--desc <desc-string>] [--kind <kind>]
         - edit specified existing task

    remove <id> - remove specified existing task

    old - show old tasks

    rebase - rebase new tasks starting with id=1; compress view of old
tasks to versioned file
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[building] agenda is designed for systems that provide the POSIX
standard programming interface; the repository includes a makefile
that simplifies the process. You need to have a compiler that fully
supports C++11.

You can use the makefile's 'install' rule to install agenda in the
standard way; you may require elevated priviledges.
